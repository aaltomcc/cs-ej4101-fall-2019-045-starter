I took this course because my current project required some background information about DevOps. I haven't studied anything about this concept before so my manager said that it would be good if I take this course and learn some new stuff. So, I applied to the course and started to learn new things!


I found this course through Fitech and this seemed a very good for me. I noticed that this course would cover all the basic things concerning DevOps and it would suite well for beginners and, thus, I decided to take it. It was very interesting to take a course from Aalto University, because I have studied my own degree in University of Oulu and it would be great to see which kind of differences there are between universities. Also, even though I studied some programming in University of Oulu, there was not a mention about DevOps in any courses. That made me think whether this concept model is a really new one.


I assumed that this course would teach me all the basic stuff: what is DevOps, what is the history behind it, what does in mean, what does it include, how do I use it, where is it currently used and so on. Also, I assumed that this course would include some kind of practical tasks to learn new things because the theorethical learning is not the best way to learn new things. I assume that after this course I would be skilled enough to use DevOps practises in my daily work and maybe learn something new later during work tasks.

I learned a lot of new things during this course. When the course begun, I had no background information about the topic. Therefore, I started to read the first documents as soon as they were available in the course home page MyCourses.


It was nice to notice that the material of this course was easy to understand. Things were explained in a easy way and I could easily follow them. Also, I found it very useful to be able to see those short videos during the course. They were easy to follow, and the reader in the videos was nice to listen.


I learned a lot of things in this course. I learned what are the differences between different version control systems and how they work. This was a very interesting and useful information and I'm sure that I will need this information in my work later. I also learned basic terms that are needed in DevOps (master, branch, commit, pull request). It was funny to notice that actually I had heard some of these terms earlier but I had never pay attention what they really mean. So, I didn't know that they had something to do with DevOps!


With the practical project I learned how to use Github, how to make commits and how to create webpages. All these things were new for me. It was nice to learn how Github works and how to implement DevOps in practice.


I think the most challenging part of the course was to use Github, however it was still pretty easy. There were not any overwhelming challenges in this course, which was good as the course was meant for beginners.
