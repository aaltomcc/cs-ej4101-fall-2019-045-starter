I took this course because my current project required some background information about DevOps. I haven't studied anything about this concept before so my manager said that it would be good if I take this course and learn some new stuff. So, I applied to the course and started to learn new things!


I found this course through Fitech and this seemed a very good for me. I noticed that this course would cover all the basic things concerning DevOps and it would suite well for beginners and, thus, I decided to take it. It was very interesting to take a course from Aalto University, because I have studied my own degree in University of Oulu and it would be great to see which kind of differences there are between universities. Also, even though I studied some programming in University of Oulu, there was not a mention about DevOps in any courses. That made me think whether this concept model is a really new one.


I assumed that this course would teach me all the basic stuff: what is DevOps, what is the history behind it, what does in mean, what does it include, how do I use it, where is it currently used and so on. Also, I assumed that this course would include some kind of practical tasks to learn new things because the theorethical learning is not the best way to learn new things. I assume that after this course I would be skilled enough to use DevOps practises in my daily work and maybe learn something new later during work tasks.
