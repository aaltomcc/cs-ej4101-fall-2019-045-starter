# **About**

This is my first web page that I have ever created. I have studied electrical engineering in University of Oulu and I graduated this autumn. My studies included some coding and I have used languages such as C++, Python and Assembly. I have created two project with C++, a lot of exercises with Python and a Pacman game. I haven't use Git before taking this course.



I am currently working on a project where we are applying DevOps practices. That's why it is very interesting to learn about this topic on this course. I hope that after this course and exercises I have broader knowledge about DevOps, Github and continuous deployment.



Here is a nice picture of a random beach:
